# Recommender Case Study

Building a movie recommendation system from the movielens dataset.

Tackled the cold start issue, by using KMeans clustering to cluster users based on age and sex, and based on those clusters, I made predictions of movies.  This was a very sparse data set, and to make predictions would have been very tough to get a high score, and so I used KMeans clustering, to fill in the data, to ultimately make a better predictor.
